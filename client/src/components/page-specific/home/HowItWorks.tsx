          Once we're in touch, we'll chat about what you want your website to
          look likeâ€”colors, vibe, and even creating a new logo if you need one.
          Then, we'll start building your website. Once it's done, we'll show
          you a demo, and you can tell us if there's anything you want to
          change. You get two chances to tweak things.
        </p>
        <p className="padding-top-40">
          After we've made all the changes you want, we'll put your website live
          on your domain name. It's a straightforward process!
